Ideas
---------------
Sorting (plus searching / binary search)
Divide-and-conquer
Dynamic programming / memoization
Greediness
Recursion
Algorithms associated with a specific data structure (which brings us to our fourth suggestion…)

Array
Stack
Queue
Hashset
Hashtable
binary tree
Heap
Graph

You should know these data structures inside and out. What are the insertion/deletion/lookup characteristics? (O(log n) for a balanced binary tree, for example.) What are the common caveats? (Hashing is tricky, and usually takes O(k) time when k is the size of the object being hashed.) What algorithms tend to go along with each data structure? (Dijkstra’s for a graph.) But when you understand these data structures, sometimes the solution to a problem will pop into your mind as soon as you even think about using the right one.

Analyst of scale
Though process is important
Think out loud
Practice on paper
Want actual code
Heaps, list, queues, stacks, btree, db algorithms
Read about google interviews online
Start with example then do code

Algorithm complexity
Sorting - quicksort/mergesort
Hashmap
Tress - binary, n-ary, trie, balanced binary tree such as red/black tree, sply, AVL
Tree traversal - BFS, DFS, inorder/postorder/preorder
Graphs - objects, points, matrix, Djkstra, A*
NP complete problems - travelling salesman, knapsack problem
Maths - combinatarics, probabilty, n-choose-k problems, discrete maths
Selection sort, heapsort, mergesort, quicksort, binary search
Adjaceny matrix, adjacncy list
Mutex, semaphore, deadlock, livelock, lock/monitor
